    connect to — e.g. RigPublish might declare "Character" -> "Character"
    and "Prop" -> "Prop", each a subfolder relative to RigPublish's own
    repo root. Added 2026-07-19 alongside RepoRef.custom_path_id: a
    pipeline ref used to point at a whole target repo; it now points at
    one specific declared location within it, since a single shared
    "...Publish" repo is rarely one undifferentiated dumping ground in
    practice. `id` is a stable uuid4 (not derived from `label`) so
    renaming a custom path doesn't invalidate every RepoRef that already
    points at it."""

    target repo's declared CustomPath entries this specific reference
    points at — every cross-repo reference in this codebase is stored as
    a (project_id, repo_id) pair rather than a bare repo id
    (local_config_store.active_project_id/active_repo_id, RepoPickerDialog's
    own return shape), since MetadataStore.get_repo(project_id, repo_id)
    always needs both regardless of whether Repo.id UUIDs happen to be
    globally unique.

    `custom_path_id=None` means "no custom path chosen yet" — only ever
    true for a RepoRef created before this field existed (backward
    compatibility for old data); every ref created through
    CustomPathsSettingsPage's "Connect Input Path" section (moved there
    2026-07-19 from ProjectGraphView's now-removed add_pipeline_ref) now
    requires picking one, since a repo can connect to the very same target
    repo more than once, each connection pointing at a different
    CustomPath (e.g. one to RigPublish's "Character" location, another to
    its "Prop" location) — something a bare (project_id, repo_id) pair
    alone couldn't distinguish.

    `direction` (added 2026-07-19) is purely cosmetic — it never affects
    ProjectGraphView._layout_nodes' level/row assignment, only which end
    of the drawn edge gets the arrowhead in ProjectGraphView.load_project:
    `"input"` (the default, matching every ref saved before this field
    existed) draws the arrow pointing INTO the repo that made this
    connection; `"output"` draws it pointing OUT of that repo toward the
