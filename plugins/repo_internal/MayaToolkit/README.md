# plugins/repo_internal/MayaToolkit/

MayaToolkit — UkoreHub's own vendored Maya scripts and plug-ins (Renamer,
RigBox, WeightPuller, `tmlib`, `UkoreMaya`, and friends, under
`maya-scripts/`), plus compiled plug-ins under `maya-plug-ins/`. Unchanged
internal layout from the original `add-on/MayaToolkit/` (moved to
`plugins/repo_internal/maya_launcher/MayaToolkit/` during the 2026-07-14
consolidation, then split back out to its own top-level plugin here on
2026-07-19 — see `plugins/repo_internal/maya_launcher/README.md` for why).

**UkorePublisher was extracted out of `maya-scripts/UkorePublisher/` on
2026-07-19** into its own top-level plugin, then split again the same day
into three type-specific plugins — `ModelPublisher`, `RigPublisher`,
`AnimationPublisher` — all built on the new
`plugins/repo_internal/PublishApi/` shared library instead of a single
shared UI/publish-path convention. `UkoreMaya/core/menu_utils.py`'s old
single `publisher()` function became three:
`model_publisher()`/`rig_publisher()`/`animation_publisher()`, each
calling `tmlib.core.File.launch("ModelPublisher")`/`"RigPublisher"`/
`"AnimationPublisher"`. **2026-08-05**: those three plugins were merged
back into one `plugins/repo_internal/MayaPublisher/` (a per-repo "Publish
Mode" setting picks Rig/Model/Animation instead of enabling a separate
plugin per mode) — `menu_utils.py`'s three functions collapsed into one
`maya_publisher()` calling `File.launch("MayaPublisher")`, still wired up
from the same three "...Publish..." menu items under
`maya-plug-ins/ukoreMaya.py`'s Model/Rig/Animation menus.
`File.launch` resolves by Python module name (`import <Name>`), not by
filesystem nesting, so this works the same way it always has once each
plugin's own `plugin.py` contributes its `PYTHONPATH` entry to the bridge
(see below).

Like every other Maya tool plugin here, this does **not** launch Maya
itself and has no UI of its own inside UkoreHub — `plugin.py`'s
`register(api)` writes `PYTHONPATH` (`maya-scripts/`) and
`MAYA_PLUG_IN_PATH` (`maya-plug-ins/`) contributions into
`plugins/repo_internal/maya_launcher/`'s shared `maya_launcher_env_bridge`
`PluginConfigStore`, read and merged by that plugin's `open_maya_file`
when it actually launches Maya. No direct import relationship with
`maya_launcher` — just the shared `PluginConfigStore` id convention (see
that plugin's README for the full bridge shape). Repository Setting >
Enable Plugin (`Repo.required_plugin_ids`) is what lets a studio admin
disable this tool per-repo; this plugin always contributes unconditionally.

**`plugins/repo_internal/UkoreBrowser/` still depends on this plugin** staying
enabled — it imports `tmlib`/`UkoreMaya` by name rather than vendoring
them itself. See that plugin's README's "External dependencies" section.
