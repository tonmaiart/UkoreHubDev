"""Publish-destination resolution — always UkoreHub's own active-repo
pipeline metadata (Project Editor's declared pipeline connections), never a
filesystem-path convention like the old '.../share/...' -> '.../publish/...'
string swap ModelPublisher/RigPublisher/AnimationPublisher used to each
carry their own copy of. This is the single source of truth all three of
those plugins (and UkoreBrowser) resolve a publish root through.

As of 2026-07-19, Project Editor only has ONE kind of pipeline connection
("Connect Pipeline Input Path...", stored under a repo's own
"pipeline_inputs" entry) — there's no separate "pipeline outputs" concept
to distinguish anymore (see plugins/core/project_editor/README.md for
why). Functions/parameters here still talk about "output" from a
Publisher plugin's own point of view (the destination it publishes into),
since that's still what tickets.py's get_publish_root_for_ticket()
resolves through these helpers — it's just reading the same unified
"pipeline_inputs" list Project Editor now stores everything in, not a
distinct "pipeline_outputs" one."""
