"""Per-ticket configuration for MayaPublisher (before the 2026-08-05
merge, three separate plugins: ModelPublisher, RigPublisher,
AnimationPublisher) — replaces the old single "repo_publish_target"
choice (one Publish Path per tool per repo, picked in a UkoreHub-side
Repo Studio Setting tab) with user-managed
**tickets**, created/renamed/deleted entirely from each tool's own Maya
window (see ticket_manager_dialog.py). Each ticket has its own display
`name`, its own immutable on-disk `folder_name`, its own `publish_target`
(a pipeline connection ref, same shape the old single choice used), and
its own folder of attached scripts. As of 2026-08-05, `function.py`'s
`publish()` does **not** export/copy any file itself — it only resolves
the destination and creates the versioned folder, then hands that off to
this ticket's attached scripts, which decide entirely for themselves what
to export/copy there (see `run_validation_scripts`'s `context` argument
below). A script whose `validate()` returns `False` (or raises) still
blocks the publish from being reported as successful, same as before —
these scripts are now both the gate *and* the mechanism.

Storage: data/plugins/core/<tool_id>.json, key "tickets", a dict keyed
by "<project_id>:<repo_id>" (the *active* repo doing the publishing — same
key shape the old "repo_publish_target" used, see _migrate_legacy_target
below for how an existing choice under that old key is carried forward).
Every function here follows repo_paths.py's own "construct the store
straight off disk" convention — Maya's Python has no PluginAPI instance to
call plugin_config_store() through.

Validation scripts are real .py files living in a **fixed, repo-committed
folder** — <active repo's own local clone>/PublishValidation/<tool_id>/ —
normally authored/edited entirely outside this tool (a text editor,
committed to the repo like any other pipeline code, shared to the whole
team via that repo's own git history), though `create_script` (added
2026-08-05) can also seed a new one from a template without leaving Maya.
A ticket just stores which of the scripts sitting in that folder apply to
it and in what order (`ticket["script_names"]`, an ordered list of
filenames — see `attach_script`/`detach_script`/`move_script`). Loading
borrows the "folder of individually loaded
scripts" convention from tmlib.core.QuickData
(plugins/repo_internal/MayaToolkit/maya-scripts/tmlib/core/QuickData.py, used by
the PythonReader toolkit, formerly "QuickScript") — same
importlib.util.spec_from_file_location/exec_module mechanism as its
run_script_file(), except we call validate() instead of run() and collect
the bool results instead of discarding them."""
