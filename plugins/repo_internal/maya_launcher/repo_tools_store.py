class RepoToolsStore:
    """Per-repo enable/disable state for whichever Maya tool plugins are
    currently contributing to the shared maya_launcher_env_bridge (see
    plugins/repo_internal/maya_launcher/README.md) — owned entirely by this plugin
    instead of the generic Repo.enabled_addon_ids mechanism. Backed by a
    single shared PluginConfigStore (api.plugin_config_store("maya_launcher",
    shared=True)), keyed "<project_id>:<repo_id>" -> [tool_id, ...].

    Stores the DISABLED set (opt-out), not the enabled set — changed
    2026-07-19 after a real ModuleNotFoundError for a brand-new tool
    (RigPublisher, then PublishApi before it) on a repo whose entry
    predated that tool's existence. The old opt-in shape had no way to
    distinguish "explicitly unchecked" from "didn't exist yet when this
    repo's list was last saved," so any repo with an existing customized
    list silently excluded every tool added after that point forever,
    requiring someone to notice and manually re-check it in Settings. With
    opt-out storage, a brand-new tool id is simply never in any repo's
    disabled set until someone actually unchecks it, so it defaults to
    enabled everywhere — matching the "no entry = everything enabled"
    behavior this store has always documented, but now true for tool ids
    added after a repo was first customized too, not just for repos with
    no customization at all.

    Unlike the pre-2026-07-19 version, this store no longer knows the set
    of tool ids itself (that used to be a hardcoded TOOL_IDS list) — every
    caller passes `all_tool_ids`, read live off the bridge by plugin.py,
    since the known tool set is now whatever independently-loaded plugin
    happened to contribute this app run."""
